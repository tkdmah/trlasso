Description: (Takada & Fujisawa, 2020, NeurIPS) proposed a method for transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain via $\ell_1$ regularization in high dimension. In addition, (Takada & Fujisawa, 2023, arXiv) extended the method to the weighted regularization to improve its theoretical properties. This is a simple implementation of the above methods.
